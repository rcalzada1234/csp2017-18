    <p>My name is Robyn Calzada and This is my about me page.
    I have been in the field of eduation for 14 years.  I started in the
    prevocational setting as a paraeducator and then began teaching math in 2007.
    I have taght Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Alebra Support, CASHEE prep, 
    Intro to Stats and SMAP. SMAP is a course designed to make sure seniors are
    ready for College Algebra when they enter the JC.  This coming school year
    I will add Computer Science Principals and Yearbook to my list of classes.
    I am also the Senior Class advisor.  Last year was my first year running the 
    senior class.  Running Graduation is the biggest event I have ever put on.
    I have also been the SST coordinator and cheerleading coach.</p>
    <br>
    <p2>I am the proud mom of two dancing girls.  They are both on competetive
    dance teams.  I am a single mom.  I became a widow at the age of 34 when
    my husband was killed.  Life is short and me and my girls live everyday
    knowing that the next is never guaranteed. If there is something you want
    to accomplish set your mind to it and run for your goal.</p>
